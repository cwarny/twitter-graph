Twitter Graph
============

Visualization of the Twitter graph, gradually generated according to what the user wants to explore. Clicking a node spawns a series of nodes representing the clicked node's followers on Twitter. The sketch communicates in real-time with the Twitter API.

The graph has a force-directed layout. A fish-eye view effect is implemented to give this nice spheric look to the graph, rendering the exploration of large graphs much clearer.
